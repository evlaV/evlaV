# SteamOS <replace-repo> Repository

This is an automatically updated mirror of the SteamOS <replace-repo> repository built from the SteamOS source packages found [here](https://steamdeck-packages.steamos.cloud/archlinux-mirror/sources). For more information, see the tool that generates this mirror, [evlav](https://github.com/evlav/evlav).

Currently, the only difference between this repository and the package sources is that the `PKGBUILD` file sources that direct to private Valve repositories have been replaced with repositories in this mirror.
